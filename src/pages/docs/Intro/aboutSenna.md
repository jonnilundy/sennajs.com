## Why did we make Senna.js?

This project was born to empower Liferay Portal, which is the leading open source portal solution for the enterprise industry. There's a strong community behind this portal solution with roughly 4 million downloads and nearly 500,000 worldwide deployments. But we didn't want it to be limited to portal, so we made it lightweight and versatile. 

> **We want developers to provide better experiences for their users, no matter what back-end solution they're using.**

We not only wanted to create an incredibly fast engine, we also needed it to not compromise on native browser capabilities like SEO, bookmarkability, independent URls, and many more. This is why we have built Senna.js to both limit redudant rendering and generate new URLs using Ajax and History API.

## The Name

This project's name is a tribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senna_%28plant%29" target="_blank">Senna (from Arabic sanƒÅ)</a>, a large genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, and the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. 

For millennia, Senna has played a major role in herbal medicine as a laxative and therefore deserves some praise.
