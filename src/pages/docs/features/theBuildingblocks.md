<article id="App">

## App

Think of this as your canvas. Everything about your site, namely your surfaces and routes, are contained within in this element.  

</article>

<article id="Surfaces">

## Surfaces 

The basic visual building blocks of your page. They are elements like your header, navbar, body, or footer. 

</article>

<article id="Screen">

## Screen

The specific rendering of all relevant surfaces. Every-time a page is requested, the navigated path will match a respective screen. This matching screen will scan all surfaces and paint the new content for those surfaces. Every screen has a unique url, but does not load as a separate page.

<article id="Route">

## Route

Every app navigation will consist of a route and a correlating screen. The route is the entire process of navigation, from when you click a link to when your app paints the new information on the screen.
