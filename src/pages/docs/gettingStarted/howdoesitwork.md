# How Does It Work?

<article id="step1">

## 1. Initial page load

When using Senna.js, your app will load all the background content, like css and script files, on the initial page load. They will be cached and used to speed up future navigation.

## 2. User clicks link to another page

When the user clicks a link to another page of your app, Senna.js begins to work its magic, first by populating a new URL even though the page did not fully reload. Everything feels normal to your user because Senna.js supports the [native browser capabilities](/docs/intro/capabilities.html).

## 3. Request is made for matching screen

The request is made for the new page but instead of pulling down a completely new package of elements from the server, Senna.js utilizes the cached resources that are redundant to both the pages.

## 4. Screen paints surfaces with new content

Quickly, Senna.js finds what content is new to the requested page and paints only the new content to the screen's surfaces, preventing your site from wasting time and bandwidth to download redundant resources.
